This is a performance predictor for NBA players. Using a random forrest AI model trained on the previous 10 games of all current NBA players, we will try to predict a basic statline for them in their upcoming game.
## How To Use
Want to test? Then you can leave `playerData.csv` as is. Otherwise, if you want to update the stats, run `fantasyProScraper.py` from the directory `/LamelosBalls/dataScraping/`. Once that script has finished running, run `finalFormatting.tcl` from that same directory.
